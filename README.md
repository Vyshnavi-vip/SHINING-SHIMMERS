# SHINING-SHIMMERS

SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION,is a ML based project.

OBJECTIVE : To build a model to recognize emotion from speech using the librosa and sklearn libraries and the RAVDESS dataset.

ABOUT THE PROJECT :
In this project, we will use the libraries librosa, soundfile, and sklearn (among others), kerasto build a model. 
This will be able to recognize emotion from sound files.
We will load the data, extract features from it, then split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Then, we’ll initialize an algorithm and train the model. 
Finally, we’ll calculate the accuracy of our model.
